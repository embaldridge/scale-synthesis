Exploring the space and time scales of organisms.

Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms.  While ecology has addressed the problems of spatial scale for some time now, it has been only recently that the data have become available to address the problem of temporal scale, although space-for-time substitutions are fairly common.  Because temporal scale ecology is still in its infancy, the problem of synthesizing the relationship between space and scale has not yet been thoroughly addressed, but is central to understanding over which scales space-for-time substitutions are effective, and the relative importance of space and time in identifying pattern generating ecological mechanisms.

The important window of space and time at which an organism operates is taxa-specific.

We know that scale is important in understanding the processes operating in ecological systems.

Gaining a better understanding of how space and time scales for different taxa could lead to identification of general trends that could provide a guide to a more targeted data collection, as well as a better understanding of the mechanisms that might be more likely to be operating for different taxa depending on the spatial and temporal scales under which those taxa primarily operate.

Life history traits are linked to both the spatial and temporal scales of an organism, with some traits allowing an organism to track time, others allowing an organism to track space, and other traits facilitating the tracking of changes in space and time.
