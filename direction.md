**Project description**  
**Introduction**  
<!--Define question-->
Create a framework for unifying absolute and relative  scales through examining how species traits (like body size) define relative spatial and temporal scale for an organism, and then identify the relationship between relative and absolute scale.

Relative scale (local vs. regional)  
Absolute scale (square meters, kilometers)  


Intra-specific abundance distribution pattern  
Intra-specific occupancy abundance pattern 
  
**Research objectives, methods, and significance** 
<!-- Define objectives from question --> 
Identify which traits are most important in defining relative space

Time
Identify which traits are most important in defining relative time

Synthesis
Develop model for defining absolute scale relative to species traits.
